We will search all `Group nodes` specifically looking  for \"CRIPT\" in the parmaeter \"name\". This is a regular expression search. The regular expression search will look for 'CRIPT' to be in any part of a \"name\", middle, end, or begining of the string. This search needs to be written into a dictionary as follow below.
