**CRIPT** (the _Community Resource for Innovation in Polymer Technology_) is a web-based platform for capturing and sharing polymer data. In addition to a user interface, CRIPT enables programmatic access to the platform through the CRIPT Python SDK, which interfaces with a REST API.

This documentation shows how to [quickly get started](./quickstart/) with the SDK, describes the various Python methods for interacting with the [API](./api/), and provides definitions and source code for [Primary](./nodes/primary/) and [Secondary](./nodes/secondary/) node objects from the CRIPT Data Model.
