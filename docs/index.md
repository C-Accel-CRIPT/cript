## CRIPT Ecosystem

**CRIPT** (the _Community Resource for Innovation in Polymer Technology_) is a web-based ecosystem for capturing and sharing polymer data. CRIPT offers multiple options for uploading data, so scientists can pick the method that best suits them. 

* <a href="https://criptapp.org/" target="_blank">The CRIPT user interface</a> which allows users to upload, browse, and search data, all from their browser.
* <a href="https://c-accel-cript.github.io/cript-excel-uploader/" target="_blank">The CRIPT Excel Uploader</a> allows easy ingestion of data into CRIPT. It was built specifically for scientists who wish to upload large amounts of structured data at once and do not have experience using Python.
* [The CRIPT Python SDK](./quickstart/) which enables programmatic access to the platform through the CRIPT REST API. Using the SDK to upload data is a great choice if you have large amounts of data, or your data is stored in an unconventional way, and you know to write some Python code. You can easily use a library such as <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a> or <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">Numpy</a> to help organize your data and create CRIPT objects/nodes so they can be uploaded into CRIPT. 

This documentation explains how to [quickly get started](./quickstart/) with the Python SDK, describes the Python methods for interacting with the [API](./api/), and provides definitions and source code for [Nodes](./nodes/all) and [Subobjects](./subobjects/all) in the CRIPT Data Model.
