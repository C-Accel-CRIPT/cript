# Project
!!! abstract
    A `Project` can be thought of as a folder containing [`Collections`](collection.md). 
    
`Projects` can be found on [CRIPT](https://criptapp.org) home screen under the [Projects link](https://criptapp.org/project/)

Each [`Collection`](collection.md) belongs inside of a single `Project`

!!! warning "Project Name"
    **Project names are globally unique**, meaning no 2 projects on the entire system can have the same name
