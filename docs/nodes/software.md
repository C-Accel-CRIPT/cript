# Software

## Definition

The `software` node contains metadata for a computation tool, code, programing language, or
software package.

Similar to the [reference](./reference.md) node, the software node does not contain the base
attributes and is meant to always be public and static.

## 
`software` is nested inside of 
<a href="../computational_process" target="_blank">`computational_process`</a>
